Your insights will help us understand user behavior, optimize workflows, and measure the effectiveness of our solutions.
Who You Are
You are a meticulous statistical analysis professional (almost pedantic) who loves uncovering hidden insights in vast data sets. You thrive on cleaning up messy metrics and refining dashboards while singing “Correlation doesn't imply causation”. You have a keen eye for spotting metrics that can be tricky or overly simplistic, and you consistently double-check their accuracy and relevance.

Work closely with product, business, and engineering teams to gather requirements and define key metrics for success.

2. Metrics Analysis & Strategy:
Develop and monitor strategic KPIs that align with organizational OKRs, ensuring they are actionable and results-oriented.
Analyze platform performance data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
Define measurements, metrics, and tools for measuring the products.

3. Dashboard Development & Reporting:
Design, develop, and maintain interactive dashboards for tracking KPIs and key data points.
Provide regular insights and reports to stakeholders, enabling informed, data-driven decision-making

4. Process Optimization:
Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in metric tracking and reporting processes, proposing innovative solutions to enhance accuracy
Ensure data integrity and accuracy across all reporting tools and systems.

5. Strategic Input:
Partner with leadership to align product analytics with broader business goals and OKRs.
Contribute to defining and refining the long-term data strategy of the company.
Qualifications & Experience
7+ years of experience in business intelligence, data analytics, or a similar field.
Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English.
Expert-level knowledge of statistics- you never mistake correlation for causation. Even if you try ;)
Self-motivated team player, able to work independently and collaboratively in a fast-paced environment, adapting to evolving team needs.
Ability to translate data into actionable insights and present findings to non-technical stakeholders.
Customer-oriented approach with a focus on providing excellent service.
Very comfortable with SQL.
Excellent pragmatism in analyzing metrics, with the ability to distinguish between valuable, actionable metric and mere trivia.

Fully remote based in Latin America
Salary: $45k-$60k USD per annum, depending on experience and location

Fully remote work from the comfort of your home
Eligibility for employee equity plan (stock options)
Reimbursement package for home office expenses, up to $1.5k
